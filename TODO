High priority:
- Clean up flood animation system (both in terms of segregating better animation state and finishing it up)
-- Add colors properly (there are some artifacts since we are doing a stupid calculation o fragshader)
-- Make it possible to have two entrance points
-- Maybe improve animation performance by stopping unnecessary work once BFS is all done?
-- Add forward and back buttons

Regular priority:
- Automatize build process, add grep for TODOs && DEBUGs
- Create documentation
- Make it so that multiple vertices can be dragged at the same time 
- Make it so that multiple vertices can be modified at the same time 
- Zoom on mouse cursor
- Create user interface (with drag and drop)
- Create DFS
- Add vertex position animations (bipartido, flux)
- Fix shader error log not working properly

Low priority:
- Recheck constants
- Remove MAX_VERTICES limit
- Render using instancing
- Add online mode
