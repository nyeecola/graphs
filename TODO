- Make it so that multiple vertices can be dragged at the same time 
- Make it so that multiple vertices can be modified at the same time 
- Zoom on mouse cursor
- Create user interface (with drag and drop)
- Create DFS
- Add vertex position animations (bipartido, flux)
- Fix shader error log not working properly
- Non-oriented graphs
- Non-pondered graphs
- Make randomizer range selectable

Low priority:
- Recheck constants
- Remove MAX_VERTICES limit
